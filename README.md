This API interacts with the Peerplays blockchain through RPC calls. The API itself is RESTful.
Future development plans are to bundle this in with a docker image.
For now, run 'python3 bookie-api.py' and be prepared to enter your python peerpays wallet password

As this API depends on the python peerplays library, please ensure it is installed with 'pip3 install peerplays --upgrade'
